Cluster the Eco-hotel dataset using Nearest Neighbors Clustering with Radius:

Description:
In this assignment, students have to use the Eco-hotel dataset from the UCI repository and perform nearest neighbors clustering on it using radius based condition rather than n_neighbors.

Assignment Instructions:
Following are the instructions for the assignment,
1) Download the dataset from the UCI repository
2) Read the data in a variable and separate on new line
3) Vectorize the data using a vectorizer
4) Train the nearest neighbors with different radius values
5) Check the cluster labels to see number of clusters.

Question 1:
Read the Eco-hotel dataset from the UCI repository and perform Nearest Neighbors clustering on it using radius based condition
